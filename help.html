      <h2>Status Area</h2>
      <p>This box displays information about the currently active punch.</p>
      <p>At the top it shows your current punch status, either In or Out.</p>
      <p>Below that, if you're punched in, it displays the date and time you punched in.</p>

      <h2>Punch In/Out Page</h2>
      <p>This is where you punch in and out, and assign punches to clients, projects and jobs.</p>
      <h3>Punch Buttons</h3>
      <p>There are three buttons in this section:</p>
      <ul class="helpList">
        <li>Punch In button</li>
        <li>Change Jobs button</li>
        <li>Punch Out button</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Punch In</h4>
      <p>Tap or click this button to start a punch.</p>
      <p>When you do, the app records the current time and saves it.</p>
      <p>The Status Area will be updated to reflect the new condition and the Assign Section is enabled to accept input.</p>
      <p>That's all you need to do to start tracking. Of course it will be more useful later if you assign your punches, but you're not required to do so before you can track time (or ever, really).</p>
      <h4>Change Jobs</h4>
      <p>Tap or click this button to punch out of an active punch and into a new one.</p>
      <p>The current time is recorded for the Out Time of the old punch and the In Time of the new punch. The old punch is stored, the and the Status Area is updated with the new punch information.</p>
      <p>The Assign Section is enabled, ready for you to assign the punch if you wish.</p>
      <h4>Punch Out</h4>
      <p>Tap or click this button to end the current punch and save it.</p>
      <h3>Assign Section</h3>
      <p>Use this section to assign the current punch to a client, project and/or a job.</p>
      <p>The elements in the Assign Section are only available if you are punched in. You can't assign a punch once you've punched out.</p>
      <p>You can assign any, all or none of the fields.</p>
      <p>Once you've tapped the Assign Button, any fields you have assigned will be stored and the Status Area will be updated. Any fields you left blank will remain enabled to accept input.</p>
      <p>It's important that you tap the Assign Button after entering text in the fields before you punch out or change jobs. If you don't, the assignment will not be saved, and any unassigned fields for that punch will be stored with the default value of "Unset".</p>
