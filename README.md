# punchcard
Web app for quick time tracking
This is a web app with a Javascript-based front-end and a (probably) PHP-based backend that will allow users to track in and out times quickly without requiring lengthy client or job setups before use.

It will provide the capability to edit punches to adjust in and out times and durations, as well as assign or reassign punches to different jobs and clients. Users will be able to optionally select and create clients and jobs from the punch screen.

It will contain robust client and job management functionality, including the ability to create, edit and archive clients, and to create, edit and archive jobs and assign jobs to clients.

It will also output the data collected and formatted in a variety of user-specified ways so users can cut and paste it into invoices and analyze the amount of time they've spent on various jobs and clients.

Punches will have a description field where users can add detail about the tasks they were performing for a particular punch.

The front-end will be lightweight and responsive so it can be used on the desktop, tablets and phones, and eventually it will be able to be loaded into certain Adobe Creative Cloud applications that support html5 extensions.

The initial purpose is to creat an app for myself to use to track time, then to allow others to use it. Ultimately I plan to release an Enterprise Version, so organizations and teams can use it for group time-recordkeeping. Toward that end, it may be ported to plugin versions that can be used with WordPress and other CMSs.
